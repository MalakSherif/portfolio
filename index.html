                <h3>Design Creative UI/UX</h3>
                <p>
                    The one thing that immediately caught my attention and sparked my enthusiasm to work in the mobile
                    applications field is the attractive and most importantly creative designs that I see in many of my
                    favorite applications.
                    I love to contribute to the UI creation and UX analysis phase as it brings me closer to the idea
                    that the customer wants to achieve and gives insight on how the customer want to features to be
                    displayed and suitable to their personality.
                    Perfecting that UI shape next to the maintanable code make the product distinctively shine through
                    its competitors as well as gain a friendly audience.

                <h3>Implement with Latest Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    You can't have a creative graphic UI without a maintainable, clean and fast code to complete a
                    powerful duo. I always try to study any software updates to distinguish the application amongst
                    others not just in shape but also in functionality.
                    Implemenation and refatoring already existing code with an updated, better working one, is always a
                    plus that the customer doesn't see but definetley feels. It can make the experience go from a place
                    to a thousand times better one.

                <h3>Provide Awareness of Software Engineering Models</h3>
                <p>One of the pros of having majored in Software Engineering is my knowledge of the process development
                    of the product. This is one thing that makes students like us different than any other self-learning
                    programmer. I can identify the customer needs and assess their requirements with the company's
                    on-hand services.
                    I can also then imagine which process model is better to work with according to the customer's
                    vision. And also contribute in the testing process and not just be there to fix bugs and get the job
                    done, but provied a deeper insight that can make the product more well-studied.

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I'm a person who has high energy and always excited to get on new projects. I love to work in a team and
                have fun while having a great output as well. I'm often a leader and like to take care of things and
                make sure they're done in an efficeint and well represented form. My goal in life is to keep learning
                new things and having new eye opening experiences. </p>
            <p>My passion for Software Engineering began from my strong interest in watching Sci-Fi movies and series. I
                have always been impressed by them and always wondered if we could make that level of fiction a reality.
                So as I studied I found that I was most attracted to mobile applications and specifically the psychology
                behind them: that every single thing we code is built on user satisfaction, or solving a user's need
                which I learnt while working in my internships and got excited to make a real impact in that field.</p>
